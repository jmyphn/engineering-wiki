# CS Major

## [Machine Learning 🧠]({{ '/csmajor-mlearn/' | relative_url }})        
Field of study on how artificial intelligence algorithms learn how to perform tasks. Covers supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning; model training, evaluation, deployment, and responsible AI. 

Career paths: ML engineer, applied scientist, data scientist, MLOps/ML platform, and research engineer.

## [Robotics 🤖]({{ '/csmajor-robotics/' | relative_url }})                 
Field of interdisciplinary study on the design, construction, and deployment of physical robots and robotic automation algorithms. Includes perception, planning, control, embedded systems, and human–robot interaction across simulation and real platforms. 

Career paths: robotics engineer, autonomy/perception engineer, controls engineer, and robotic systems integrator across manufacturing, logistics, mobility, and healthcare.

## [Low-Level Systems ⚙️]({{ '/csmajor-comparch/' | relative_url }})       
Field of study on the design and construction of computer systems and their component parts. Focuses on architecture, operating systems, compilers, concurrency, memory, and performance profiling. 

Career paths: systems software engineer, performance engineer, embedded/firmware engineer, kernel/OS engineer, and compiler engineer.

## [Distributed Systems 🌎]({{ '/csmajor-distsys/' | relative_url }})
Field of study on the design, construction, and analysis of large-scale systems. Covers consensus, fault tolerance, replication, scalability, data consistency models, and observability. 

Career paths: distributed systems/backend engineer, SRE/platform engineer, database engineer, and cloud infrastructure engineer.

## [Data Science 🔢]({{ '/csmajor-datasci/' | relative_url }})       
Interdisciplinary field of study that uses algorithms and systems to extrapolate knowledge from data. Combines statistics, ML, data engineering, and visualization with emphasis on cleaning data, experimentation, and communicating insights.

Career paths: data scientist, analytics/ML engineer, data engineer, product analyst, and quant/BI specialist.
